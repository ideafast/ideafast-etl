# IDEA-FAST WP3 ETL Pipeline

A Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline based on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). It periodically _extracts_ sensor data from wearables and mobile apps used in the [IDEA-FAST](www.idea-fast.eu) clinical observation study, _transforms_ the data by associating the appropriate anonymised participants, and _loads_ the data into the IDEA-FAST Data Management Portal.

## Installation

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for dependency management and
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python installations, so
please install both on your local machine. We use python 3.8 by default, so
please make sure this is installed via pyenv, e.g.

    pyenv install 3.8.0 && pyenv global 3.8.0

Once done, you can install dependencies for this project via:

    poetry install --no-dev

To setup a virtual environment with your local pyenv version run:

    poetry shell

## Local Development

For development, install additional dependencies through:

    poetry install
    poetry run pre-commit install
